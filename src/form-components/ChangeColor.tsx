/*

The ChangeColor component offers the user a bunch of radio buttons labeled with different colors; choosing a radio button updates the text and color of a nearby box of text.

You will need state to represent the chosen color
You are free to make up your own list of colors, but you must have AT LEAST 8 unique colors.
Each color must be represented by a radio button.
There should be a box of text with a data-testid="colored-box" attribute and value.
The box of text should have the same text and backgroundColor style as the currently selected radio button.
HINT: We strongly recommend you use map to render all the colorâ€™s Form.Check tags rather than hardcoding each one!

HINT: We recommend you use the inline attribute for the radio buttons.
